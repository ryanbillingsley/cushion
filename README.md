# cushion

A really simple Buffer API client in Elixir
More to come...**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

  1. Add cushion to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:cushion, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. cushion uses HTTPotion so you need to add ibrowse to your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:ibrowse]]
        end
